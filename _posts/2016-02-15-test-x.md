**IS-7**

The IS-7 is a Soviet tier 10 heavy tank. Development of the IS-7 started in the spring of 1945\. Prototypes successfully underwent trials in 1946 and 1947\. However, the IS-7 never saw mass production. With it's well angled "pike-nose" frontal armor layout and a rounded, highly sloped turret front, the IS-7 is one of the toughest nuts to crack when engaged from the front. If positioned behind a piece of cover which shields it's lower glacis plate, it becomes a hardened object with so few weak points that successfully damaging the tank turns into a most frustrating experience. Therein lies a weakness, however - the IS-7 cannot angle it's armor, because if it does, the sloping of the frontal plate will become significantly worsened and enable most guns to punch through with relative ease. The side armor of the tank is comprised of spaced plates which are not only small but angled as well, making even perfectly landed shots to the hull's midsection fail to do any sort of damage at times. The rear armor is quite thin, however, and will rarely deflect even lower tier guns. The IS-7 mounts a very potent 130mm S-70 naval cannon as it's main gun. While it's potentially high penetration values and damage output can seem quite formidable, the gun itself is largely inaccurate, has a very long aiming time, takes awhile to load and is actually much less effective than it seems. Nevertheless, at close and medium ranges the gun can still inflict very serious damage. Sustainability of said damage is difficult, though, due to the aforementioned long reload and aim times. When compared to it's Soviet counterpart, the IS-4, the IS-7 instantly feels more responsive and agile. It has a higher top speed and can change direction with much greater ease. The IS-7 also isn't quite as well rounded as the IS-4, relying mostly on it's incredible frontal armor to deflect and absorb incoming damage as opposed to the IS-4's effective all-around hull armor. Due to the side armor's spaced layout, however, side scraping is a very viable tactic and should be utilized when possible. The 130mm gun is not as accurate, though more damaging, as the 122mm gun of the IS-4 and will not handle as well either. Overall, the IS-7 is definitely an up-close-and-personal fighter and should be used as such. Your teammates will rely on you to take and deflect the majority of incoming fire while they in turn support your advance and use their (hopefully) more accurate guns to assist in whittling down the enemy team. Expect to do some heavy lifting when driving the IS-7 and use it's key advantages to fight on your own terms and dictate the flow of the battle, improving your performance and probability of success.

The IS-3 is a Soviet tier 8 heavy tank. Mass production of the vehicle started in May 1945\. On September 7,1945, IS-3 tanks took part in the Allied Victory Parade through Berlin. A total of 1170 vehicles were manufactured by the end of 1946, when production was canceled. From 1948 through the late 1950s, the tanks underwent a number of modernization refits. The IS-3 has more agility and speed than the German Pz.Kpfw. Tiger II, and finds itself at home engaging in close-quarters combat. While not having as thick of frontal hull armor as its German counterpart, it more than makes up for this because it is sloped and has agility. The front of its upgraded turret is also very armored and sloped, making it difficult to penetrate, and has small weak points. However, it cannot use that to hull down very well because it is small and lacks gun depression. The IS-3 is also a devastating tank up front when it is equipped with its top gun, with solid alpha damage and high penetration.
